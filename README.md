Old Spice Voicemail
===================

This is a static (formerly PHP) web app to generate voicemail mp3s from the Old Spice Guy's voice in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8JsvwUcok0).

It was originally created by [area](https://www.reddit.com/user/area) on Reddit. MP3 rips and design by [Nelson Abalos Jr.](http://nelsonabalosjr.com/) (unfortunately this link is now dead. I haven't found a replacement.)

Many thanks to the folks on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/cpkpu/old_spice_man_records_voicemail_message_for/) Reddit thread!
