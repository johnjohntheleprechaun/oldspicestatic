This is a static (formerly PHP) web app to generate voicemail audio files from the Old Spice Guy's voice in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8JsvwUcok0).

It was originally created by [area](https://www.reddit.com/user/area) on Reddit. MP3 rips and original design by [Nelson Abalos Jr.](https://twitter.com/thepixelgeek)
